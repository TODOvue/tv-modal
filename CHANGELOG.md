- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-modal.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
- For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-modal/style.css'` in `main.ts`
- For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-modal/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.
- Added `./style.css` export path in `package.json` for explicit CSS imports.
